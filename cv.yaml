skills:
  - name: Python 3
    level: 8
    notes:
      - I have been programming Python for 6+ years and it is by far my most
        efficient language to work in. That being said, it is not the tool I
        use for tasks that necessitate high runtime speed and efficiency.
      - I wrote my [first commissioned site](http://www.dollarsfordrs.com/)
        in the Python Flask framework.
      - I created an
        [API for the Periodic Table of Elements](https://rapidapi.com/PappasBrent/api/periodic-table-of-elements/)
        using Flask and the SQLAlchemy ORM.
      - I leveraged Python web scraping libraries to obtain all the data for
        all the cards in the trading card game _Cardfight!! Vanguard_,
        and then used that data to build
        [an API](https://card-fight-vanguard-api.ue.r.appspot.com/api/v1/docs)
        for the game.
      - I have used the Selenium framework to create automated test cases while
        working as a QA coordinator at Baggage Airlines Guest Services
      - I have scripted automated solutions to countless pain points in
        my work life using Python.
  - name: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    level: 6
    notes:
      - I have been working in these three languages for 5+ years.
      - I have experience with the Bootstrap library, and used it to design my
        [first commissioned site](http://www.dollarsfordrs.com/)
      - I used NodeJs and the Express web framework to create a
        [full-stack web application](http://www.pallet-town.me/)
        featuring user authentication and back-end image processing to
        facilitate online play of the _Pok√©mon Trading Card Game_.
      - I used these languages to implement the
        [landing page](https://card-fight-vanguard-api.ue.r.appspot.com)
        of
        [an API I wrote](https://card-fight-vanguard-api.ue.r.appspot.com/api/v1/docs)
        for obtaining information about the card game _Cardfight!! Vanguard_.
      - I have written about a
        [dozen web games](https://lightwatch.itch.io)
        in plain JavaScript and HTML5.

  - name: Java
    level: 5
    notes:
      - For almost two years I tutored Object Oriented Programming for

        taught in Java during the time I was a tutor.
  - name: Go
    level: 5
    notes:
      - I have recently started learning in Go and it has become
        my compiled language of choice because of its speed and simplicity.
      - I created
        [an API for the trading card game _Cardfight!! Vanguard_](https://card-fight-vanguard-api.ue.r.appspot.com/api/v1/docs)
        entirely in Go using the Gin web framework and GORM ORM.
      - I wrote a [2-dimensional language parser](https://github.com/PappasBrent/flagon)

        to an S3 instance.
      - I used the AWS SDK boto3 to make
        thousands of card scans easily available to users of my

      - While I was a peer mentor at UCF I learned to effectively communicate
        with a variety of individuals, including fellow students, professors,
        and other tutors.
      - I frequently tutored more than a dozen students at a time in group
        tutoring sessions for classes in computer programming.
      - I began this position as a peer tutor and after 1 year I was promoted
        to the position of peer mentor because of my ability to assess others'
        communication skills and advise them on how they may improve.
